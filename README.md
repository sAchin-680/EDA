## Overview

This system enables real-time analysis of property prices by ingesting data from multiple sources, processing it with a serverless data pipeline, and applying machine learning models to predict future price trends. The frontend, built with Next.js, provides an intuitive interface for users to visualize data, track trends, and receive notifications on market changes.

## Architecture

This project follows an event-driven, microservices-based architecture. Key components include:

- **Data Ingestion**: Real-time data is ingested using AWS Lambda and processed for analytics.
- **Machine Learning**: AWS SageMaker or an equivalent ML framework for price prediction models.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Leveraging AWS services (e.g., Kinesis, SNS, SQS) for data streaming and notifications.
- **Serverless Functions**: Microservices-based approach with AWS Lambda for cost-effective scalability.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Ingestion and Processing**: Ingest and process data from APIs, handling large data volumes with AWS Lambda and Kinesis.
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: Predict property prices and trends using a trained ML model.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and visualizations using D3.js or Chart.js for exploring data insights.
- **Scalable Cloud Architecture**: Deployed on AWS using serverless and cloud-native technologies.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Automated alerts based on pricing changes, driven by AWS SNS.

## Tech Stack

- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (Lambda, S3, Kinesis, SageMaker, API Gateway)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, AWS Lambda
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, D3.js
- **Machine Learning**: Python (SageMaker, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- **Database**: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL) and DynamoDB
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Serverless Framework
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch, Sentry

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14 or higher
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) (optional for deployment)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-analysis.git
    cd real-estate-analysis
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    cd backend && npm install
    cd ../frontend && npm install
    ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
   Create `.env` files in both `backend` and `frontend` directories for your configuration. Refer to `.env.example` for required variables.

4. **Run Locally**:
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm start
     ```
   - Frontend:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm run dev
     ```

## Usage

- **Data Ingestion**: Triggered by AWS Lambda functions to pull data from APIs.
- **ML Predictions**: Process data and make predictions using the ML model, accessed via API.
- **Frontend**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` for the Next.js application to explore data, charts, and predictions.
